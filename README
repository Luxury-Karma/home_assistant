This is my script for my home assistant model.

The goal of this is to make a off line home assistant running out of a rasberrypy.
This should have a amount of preset sentences to do action that will be added to the script.
One of the action (optional) will be to connect it to a local (or internet if you want) LLM to have interaction with it. 


The voice is generated using espeakng

The audio detection is made using vosk. Right now two model are built in (French and English).

The video detection is handle by YOLO11.
